# Backend Projects

This repository holds solutions to a range of projects from the [Backend Developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) Roadmap. The projects are grouped into three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.

For each project, you'll find solutions implemented in different programming languages, allowing you to explore how the same problem can be solved using various tech stacks. Each project is organized in its own folder, and within each folder, the language-specific solutions are further divided.
